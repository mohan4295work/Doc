⚠️ AI Tools Usage Policy – Email Guidelines
To ensure data privacy and maintain professional boundaries during AI tool experimentation:

Do not use personal or finance-linked email IDs when testing or evaluating AI tools.

Create a separate, dedicated email account specifically for learning, testing, and development purposes.

This practice helps safeguard sensitive information and ensures a clean separation between personal data and experimental workflows.
